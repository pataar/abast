# abast
Automation of Boring And Slow Tasks (ABAST) is a collection of commands to automate boring and slow tasks.

It's mainly built for myself to automate tasks I do often, but I hope it can be useful for others too.

It uses OpenAI in certain commands to do lots of boring typing and filling repetitive forms.
